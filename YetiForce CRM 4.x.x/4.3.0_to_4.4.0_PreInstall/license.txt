System update description 
Before updating the system we should always create a full backup copy (files + database).
We enable error logging and only then can we begin the installation procedure. 

System update consists of 3 parts:
1. Install package: 4.3.0_to_4.4.0_PreInstall.zip
2. Install package: 4.3.0_to_4.4.0.zip
3. Launch CRON that will reload some time consuming elements. It will make the update process shorter.

In case any errors appear during the update please copy the cache/logs directory and send it to github@yetiforce.com
